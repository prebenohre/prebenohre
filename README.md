<h1 id="heading" align="center">Hey, I'm Preben! 👋</h1>
I'm studying for a Bachelor's degree in Programming at Kristiania University College in Oslo, and I'm currently in the final stretch of my third and last year. 👨🏼‍🎓
<br>
<br>
During my studies, I have specialized in backend programming, web development and API design, database management, OOP, software design, algorithms and data structures, C programming, DevOps, and microservices. I have developed a strong interest in backend development and system architecture, and I’m really looking forward to working as a ✨ b a c k e n d d e v e l o p e r ✨ once I complete my studies.
<br>
<br>
Alongside my studies, I am also the head of the Trust Committee at the Department of Economics, Innovation, and Technology within the Student Union at Kristiania. Here, my fellow students and I work together to improve academic opportunities and safeguard the rights and needs of our peers! 👨🏻‍⚖️
<br>
<br>
When I’m not buried in Rider, I enjoy producing music, making homemade wine, or unwinding with some gaming. 🎸🍷👾
<br>
<br>
Feel free to reach out if you or your company have projects that might be a good fit for me, are looking to recruit, or if you just want to chat about technology—I’m always up for a great coding conversation! 🚀🤓
