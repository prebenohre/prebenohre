<h1 id="heading" align="center">Hey, I'm Preben! 👋</h1>
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Programming at Kristiania University College in Oslo, and I'm well into my third and final year. 👨🏻‍💻
<br>
<br>
During my studies, I’ve focused on web development, database management, OOP, software design, algorithms and data structures, C programming for Linux, and information security. Recently, we completed a semester project in "Agile Project Management," where I served as the SCRUM master 🤠. This project provided me with valuable experience in agile methodologies and team leadership. I’ve developed a strong interest in backend programming and full-stack web development, and I'm really looking forward to working as a ✨d e v e l o p e r✨ after I graduate.
<br>
<br>
Outside of my studies, I also serve as the Head of the Student Representative Committee for the Department of Economics, Innovation, and Technology at the Kristiania Student Union. Here, my fellow students and I work together to enhance academic opportunities and safeguard the rights and needs of our peers! 👨🏻‍⚖️
<br>
<br>
I'm also the Events Coordinator for the BIOS student association. In this role, I’m involved in communication with companies as well as coordinating and executing events. This gives me the chance to use my organizational skills while having fun with my fellow students 🥳.
<br>
<br>
When I'm not deep in IntelliJ or planning events, I enjoy producing music, making homemade wine, or unwinding with some gaming. 🎸🍷👾
