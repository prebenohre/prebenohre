# Hey there! 👋
I'm Preben, currently pursuing a degree in software engineering at Kristiania University College in Oslo. 🤓
<br>
My journey in tech has been a thrilling ride, exploring web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js, diving into the world of database management with MySQL, and embracing object-oriented programming in Java and C#. I've found true passion in these subjects, and I'm eagerly looking forward to becoming a ✨full-stack developer✨ once I complete my studies!

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me crafting some soothing Lofi Hip-Hop beats, experimenting with homemade wine production, or indulging in a bit of gaming. 🎷🍷🎮

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat tech – I'm always up for a good coding conversation! 🚀
